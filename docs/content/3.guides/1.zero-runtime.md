title: Zero Runtime
description: Create OG Images without the server runtime overhead.
---

When using Nuxt as a server-side app with prerendered OG Images, you are forced to have runtime OG images as well which added
significant overhead to the server build.

To address this, we introduce the `zeroRuntime` config, which ensures all tree-shakable OG image code is removed from the final output.

## Usage

To enable zero runtime, add the following to your config:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default {
  ogImage: {
    zeroRuntime: true
  }
}
```

You will need to make sure you're prerendering all of your pages that use OG images, as the server runtime will not be available.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true,
      routes: [
        '/',
        // ...
      ],
    },
  }
})
```

## Limitations

When using the Zero Runtime mode none of the community templates will be available in your final build, you must copy+paste any community template that you wish to use into your `components/OgImage` folder.

## Benchmarks

**Nuxt OG Image - Defaults**

Nitro: 1.6mb
- node_modules: 25mb

**Nuxt OG Image - Zero Runtime**

Nitro: 306kb (81% reduction)
- node_modules: 2.0mb (92% reduction)
