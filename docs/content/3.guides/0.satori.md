description: Learn how to use the Satori renderer.

Nuxt OG Image comes with two ways of rendering your images, the default way is using [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

Satori will be used to render images in all environments, unless you have explicitly disabled it.

## Pros

- Fast
- Works on all environments

## Cons

- A number of limitations (see below)

## Limitations

It's important to familiarize yourself Satori with before you make more complex templates.

If you find Satori too difficult to work with, you can use the [Chromium Renderer](/og-image/guides/chromium) renderer instead.

To learn more about the limitations and working around them, see:

- [Icons and Images](/og-image/guides/icons-and-images)
