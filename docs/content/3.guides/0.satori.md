description: Learn how to use the Satori renderer.

Nuxt OG Image comes with two ways of rendering your images, the default way is using [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

It's not necessary to manually define the renderer as `satori` unless you set the default to the [Chromium Renderer](/og-image/guides/chromium).
Satori will be used to render images in all environments, unless you have explicitly disabled it.

::code-group

```ts [Set Default]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // this is not necessary as satori is already the default
  ogImage: {
    defaults: {
      renderer: 'satori'
    }
  }
})
```

```ts [defineOgImageComponent]
defineOgImageComponent({
  renderer: 'satori' // only when the default has been changed
})
```

## Pros

- Fast
- Works on all environments

## Cons

- A number of limitations (see below)

## Limitations

It's important to familiarize yourself Satori with before you make more complex templates.

If you find Satori too difficult to work with, you can use the [Chromium Renderer](/og-image/guides/chromium) renderer instead.
