description: Create minimal reproductions for Nuxt OG Image or just experiment with the module.

You can use the following Stackblitz playgrounds to experiment with Nuxt OG Image.

If you run into any issues with Nuxt OG Image, it's recommended to clone of these playgrounds Stackblitz
to reproduce the issue.

## Stackblitz Playgrounds

- [Nuxt OG Image - Basic](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-pxs3wk?file=pages/index.vue)
- [Nuxt OG Image - Nuxt Content](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-hgunsf?file=package.json)

## Stackblitz Compatibility

StackBlitz runs Nuxt within a webcontainer, so it has fairly limited compatibility.

- You can't use anything that will require a fetch request to a different server (e.g. Google Fonts, custom Emojis, images, etc).
- The `chromium` renderer is not supported
- `sharp` is not supported, so you can't use JPEGs
- `inline-css` is not supported, so you can't `<style>` blocks
