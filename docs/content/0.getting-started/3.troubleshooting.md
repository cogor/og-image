## Debugging

### Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt OG Image.

This will show you your OG Image and give you all of the debug information.

### Debug Config

You can enable the [debug](/docs/og-image/api/config#debug) option which will give you more granular output.

## Submitting an Issue

You can use the following Stackblitz playgrounds to experiment with Nuxt OG Image and submit issues.

If you run into any issues with Nuxt OG Image, it's recommended to clone of these playgrounds Stackblitz
to reproduce the issue.

- [Nuxt OG Image - Basic](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-pxs3wk?file=pages/index.vue)
- [Nuxt OG Image - Nuxt Content](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-hgunsf?file=package.json)

### Stackblitz Compatibility

StackBlitz runs Nuxt within a webcontainer, so it has fairly limited compatibility.

- You can't use anything that will require a fetch request to a different server (e.g. Google Fonts, custom Emojis, images, etc).
- The `chromium` renderer is not supported
- `sharp` is not supported, so you can't use JPEGs
- `inline-css` is not supported, so you can't `<style>` blocks
