description: How to use the Nuxt OG Image module with Nuxt Content.
---

Nuxt OG Image integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box.

It supports the `ogImage` frontmatter key that can be used to configure your OG Image.

This will only work when you're using Document Driven mode, or you have set a `path` and are using the `useContentHead` composable.

## Setup

Add the `ogImage` key on your frontmatter. This has the same options as `defineOgImage`.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
ogImage:
  component: BlogOgImage
  props:
    image: /blog/3-months-of-europe.png
    readingMins: 5
---
```

If you're not using Document Driven mode, you must use the `path` key on your frontmatter.

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
---
path: /blog/3-months-of-europe
ogImage:
  component: BlogOgImage
  props:
    image: /blog/3-months-of-europe.png
    readingMins: 5
---
```

If you're not using `documentDriven` mode and all of your content paths are the same as their real paths,
you can enable `strictNuxtContentPaths` to get the same behaviour.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    strictNuxtContentPaths: true
  }
})
```

Additionally, you will need to make sure you're using the `useContentHead` composable if you're not using Document Driven mode.

```vue [post.vue]
<script setup>
const page = await useAsyncData(`docs-${route.path}`, () => queryContent(route.path).findOne())
useContentHead(page)
</script>
```

If you have issues with your `ogImage` data not updating, you may need to clear the `.nuxt/content-cache` folder.

### Using Components

If you'd like to use the `<OgImage />` or `<OgImageScreenshot />` components within your content instead of using
frontmatter, you'll need
to make the components global.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ogImage: {
    componentOptions: {
      global: true,
    }
  }
})
```

```md [content/blog/3-months-of-europe.md]
:OgImage{component="BlogOgImage" image="/blog/3-months-of-europe.png" readingMins="5"}
```
