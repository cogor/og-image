In some cases, you'll want to apply OG Image setting for a subset of pages.

You can handle this even easier
with the route rule merging.

This lets you provide a `ogImage` key that will be either used or merged into the existing OG Image options.

For example, this documentation website uses it to set the `icon` depending on your path.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/og-image/**': {
      ogImage: {
        props: { icon: 'carbon:image-search' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
