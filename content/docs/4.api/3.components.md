It's recommended to use composables over components, as they are more flexible and will provide better type safety.

## `OgImage`

Render a customisable OG Image.

Uses the [defineOgImage](/og-image/api/define-og-image) composable.

```vue
<template>
  <OgImage />
</template>
```

## `OgImageScreenshot`

Takes a screenshot of the page and uses it as the image.

Uses the [defineOgImageScreenshot](/og-image/api/define-og-image-screenshot) composable.

```vue
<template>
  <OgImageScreenshot />
</template>
```
